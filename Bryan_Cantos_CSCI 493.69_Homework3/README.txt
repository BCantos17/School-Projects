i) h1, h2, h3 and h4 were completed

ii) No bugs found

iii) Type <make all> to compile everything. To run them, type 
		./h1 <INPUT_PGM_IMAGE> <OUTPUT_PGM_IMAGE>
		./h2 <INPUT_PGM_IMAGE> <THRESHOLD> <OUTPUT_PGM_IMAGE>
		./h3 <INPUT_PGM_IMAGE> <OUTPUT_PGM_IMAGE>
        	./h4 <INPUT_GREY_IMAGE> <INPUT_HOUGH_IMAGE> <THRESHOLD> <OUTPUT_IMAGE>

		for h4, try a threshold of 150

iv) Inputs files
        h1 - hough_simple_1.pgm or hough_simple_2.pgm or hough_complex.pgm
        h2 - output file from p1
        h3 - output file from p2
        h4 - hough_simple_1.pgm or hough_simple_2.pgm or hough_complex.pgm and the corresponding hough image
