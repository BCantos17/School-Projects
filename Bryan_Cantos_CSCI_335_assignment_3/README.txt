i) All parts were completeled
	look at load_factor_analysis.txt to view multiple test at different load factors
	look at hashmap_results.txt to view MyHashMap with different sizes

ii) I could not find any bugs

iii) Type Make all to compile everything. To run them, type
		./Hashing
			it has a function commented out that test the probes at different load factors base on the amount of insertion the user wants to do.

        ./testMaps <word file name>
               ask for word to look for

        ./testMyHashMap <word file  name>   <size of HashMap>
                ask for word to look for
                has a display function that is commented out, uncomment it out to see everything in the HashMap
